# ND Forez

ND Forez is a data analysis tool for non-denaturing phoresis of genomic libraries. It evaluates library quality, fragment length distribution, and concentration. The system identifies DNA size standards and library peaks, estimates fragment sizes and concentrations, builds a calibration curve, visualizes results as electropherograms and chromatograms, and generates PDF reports.

Tech stack:

    Frontend: TypeScript, React, Vite, Material UI, Chart.js
    Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, NumPy, SciPy, PyWavelets
