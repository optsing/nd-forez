    """
    Partial reproduction of MATLAB's `wden` function for denoising a signal using wavelet transform.
    This version implements only a subset of the original functionality.

    Parameters:
    - signal: 1D array-like, input signal to denoise
    - tptr: threshold selection rule (only 'sqtwolog' is supported)
    - sorh: thresholding type, 's' for soft or 'h' for hard
    - scal: threshold rescaling method (only 'sln' is supported: single level noise estimation)
    - level: decomposition level for wavelet transform
    - wname: wavelet name (e.g., 'sym2')

    Returns:
    - Denoised signal as a NumPy array, same length as input
